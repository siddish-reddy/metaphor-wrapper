v0:

1. extension boiler plate setup
2. on click: get current tab url -> open metaphor tab with query url
3. get scroll percentage and if 80%, show popup to see similar sites?


Pre AI wrapper:

1. Personal indexing: BM25 of history, and the links mentioned in those pages.
2. If metaphor results are dumb, then fallback to results from history.
