v0:

- [x] extension boiler plate setup
- [x] on click: get current tab url -> open metaphor tab with query url
- [ ] get scroll percentage and if 80%, show popup to see similar sites?


v0 workflow examples:
1. Go to a lesswrong post or some blog, click extension, boom ðŸ˜‚.
1. Go to a SaaS page, click extension, add "Github.com" in filters and find open source alternatives.


Pre AI wrapper:

1. Personal indexing: BM25 of history, and the links mentioned in those pages.
2. If metaphor results are not relevant, then fallback to results from history/bookmarks.

v1:
1. for articles: get pages with contradicting ideas
2. similar articles but from other disciplines (AI agents -> )
